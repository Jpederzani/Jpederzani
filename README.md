Hi, Iâ€™m Jon (@Jpederzani) and I'm a Computer Science Major at Judson University in Elgin, IL.  I don't really know what to put on this page yet so I'm going to stick with the default categories they give.  Prepare to get to know me as Github thinks fit:

My Interests are:
  - **My Family**
  - **Guitar** *(I really like guitars)*
  - **R/C Cars** 
  - **Mathematics & Computer Science**
  - **Building Computers** *(well, buying hardware and sticking it on a motherboard)*
	
	
Iâ€™m currently learning basic design principles, structures, and algorithms used in software development.  I also am working toward a minor in mathematics.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that allows me to gain experience and become more fluent with programming languages.

ðŸ“« How to reach me:
  - Send me a DM (Direct Message) here on GitHub, we can work from there (or whatever information is displayed by Git)
