Hi, Iâ€™m Jon (@Jpederzani) and I'm currently holding a full-stack web developer position with a small startup company in the beautiful midwestern United States.  Web development is fun but I am looking to apply my skills in new ways and hopefully find some new hobbies in the process.

My Interests are:
  - **My Family**
  - **Guitar** *(I really like guitars)*
  - **R/C Cars** 
  - **Mathematics & Computer Science**
  - **Building Computers** *(well, buying hardware and sticking it on a motherboard)*
	
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that allows me to gain new experience, work with new technologies, or just have some nerdy fun.

ðŸ“« How to reach me:
  - Send me a DM (Direct Message) here on GitHub, we can work from there (or whatever information is displayed by Git)
